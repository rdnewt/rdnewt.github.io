I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Signal and Image Processing & Machine Learning track of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano, Ph.D.](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Peter Seiler, Ph.D.](https://controls.engin.umich.edu/profile/peter-seiler/)

Most broadly, I am interested in interdisciplinary projects that use advancements in one or more adjacent fields to develop methods to solve complex problems. My current work focuses on using recent non-convex optimization techniques to develop reduced-order models for wind farm control.
