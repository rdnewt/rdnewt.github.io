I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Signal and Image Processing & Machine Learning track of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano, Ph.D.](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Peter Seiler, Ph.D.](https://controls.engin.umich.edu/profile/peter-seiler/) I am fortunate to be supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship.

My research focuses on nonconvex optimization problems with applications in reduced-order modeling for wind farm control.
